# Week 2 – Garbage Classification

This is Week 2 of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship Project (Garbage Classification).

## 🔍 Objective:
To load a trained CNN model from Week 1 and test it with new garbage images to verify prediction capabilities.

## 📁 Files:
- `Week2_Garbage_Classification.ipynb`: Loads the trained model and predicts the garbage category from a custom test image.
- `garbage_classifier_model.h5`: Pre-trained model from Week 1.
- Test Image (e.g., `metal can trash.jpeg`): Used to test predictions.

## ✅ Tasks Performed:
- Mounted Google Drive and loaded saved `.h5` model
- Preprocessed uploaded image
- Ran prediction and visualized result with `matplotlib`
- Displayed predicted class name

## 🧠 Outcome:
The model successfully predicted the category of custom test image with reasonable accuracy.
