Week 2 â€“ Improvisations over Week 1:

1. Instead of training a new model, we reused the trained model from Week 1.
2. Used OpenCV to load and preprocess a new test image.
3. Used matplotlib to display the image along with the predicted label.
4. Created a clear separation between training (Week 1) and prediction (Week 2).
5. Validated model generalization by testing on an unseen image.
